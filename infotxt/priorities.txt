Priorities -

1) Monitoring - we need to understand what is going on in order to be able to adjust things

2) Predator-Prey are currently kind of coupled I believe? Examine this, find out if this is true, if it is go to step 3)

3) FOV, if the PP's are "coupled", we need to remove the coupling and make every other dot that is within a specific FOV visible.

4) The FOV should be different, predators have eyes in front of the head and see in more "narrowly" but further away, prey on the other hand, see a bigger radius, but not so far away.

5) Storing the results of the simulation? Currently if we stop it, we're fucked?
